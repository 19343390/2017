Lesson overview
===============

In this week's lesson we will introduce you a spatial data model (geometric objects) and some basics of how spatial data
can be manipulated in pure Python.

After this weeks lesson your should be able to:

  - Explain how functions are used and their benefits
  - Create your own functions to calculate an output value based on an input value
  - Save functions to a script file for future use
