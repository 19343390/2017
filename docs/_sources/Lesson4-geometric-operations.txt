Geometric operations
====================

Overlay analysis
----------------

The aim here is to make an overlay analysis where we select only specific polygon cells from the data
based on the borders of municipality of Helsinki.


Let's first read the data.

.. code:: python

    import geopandas as gpd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # File paths
    border_fp = "/home/geo/data/Helsinki_borders.shp"
    grid_fp = "/home/geo/data/TravelTimes_to_5975375_RailwayStation.shp"

    # Read files
    grid = gpd.read_file(grid_fp)
    hel = gpd.read_file(border_fp)

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

    import gdal
    import geopandas as gpd
    import os
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    border_fp = os.path.join(os.path.abspath('data'), "Helsinki_borders.shp")
    grid_fp = os.path.join(os.path.abspath('data'), "TravelTimes_to_5975375_RailwayStation.shp")
    grid = gpd.read_file(grid_fp)
    hel = gpd.read_file(border_fp)


Let's check that the coordinate systems match.

.. ipython:: python

    hel.crs
    grid.crs

They do.

Let's see how our datasets look like, let's use the Helsinki municipality layer as our basemap and
plot the other layer on top of that.

.. ipython:: python


    basemap = hel.plot()
    grid.plot(ax=basemap, linewidth=0.02);

    # Use tight layout
    @savefig helsinki_grid_borders.png width=7in
    plt.tight_layout()

Let's do an overlay analysis and select polygons from grid that intersect with our Helsinki layer.

.. ipython:: python

    result = gpd.overlay(grid, hel, how='intersection')

Let's plot our data and see what we have.

.. ipython:: python

    result.plot(color="b")

    # Use tight layout
    @savefig helsinki_grid_borders_intersect.png width=7in
    plt.tight_layout()


Cool! Now as a result we have only those grid cells included that intersect with the Helsinki borders
and the grid cells are clipped based on the boundary.

Whatabout the data attributes? Let's see what we have.

.. ipython:: python

    result.head()

Nice! Now we have attributes from both layers included.

Let's see the length of the GeoDataFrame.

.. ipython:: python

    len(result)

And the original data.

.. ipython:: python

    len(grid)

Let's save our result grid as a GeoJSON file that is another commonly used file
format nowadays for storing spatial data.

.. code:: python

    resultfp = "/home/geo/data/TravelTimes_to_5975375_RailwayStation_Helsinki.geojson"

    # Use GeoJSON driver
    result.to_file(resultfp, driver="GeoJSON")

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

    resultfp = os.path.join(os.path.abspath('data'), "TravelTimes_to_5975375_RailwayStation_Helsinki.geojson"
    result.to_file(resultfp, driver="GeoJSON")

.. note::

    There are many more examples for different types of overlay analysis in `Geopandas documentation  <http://geopandas.org/set_operations.html>`_ where you can go and learn more.

Aggregating data
----------------

Aggregating data can also be useful sometimes. What we mean by aggregation is that we basically merge Geometries into together by some common identifier.
Suppose we are interested in studying continents, but we only have country-level data like the country dataset.
By aggregation we would convert this into a continent-level dataset.

Let's aggregate our travel time data by car travel times, i.e. the grid cells that have the same travel time to Railway Station will be merged together.

.. ipython:: python

   result_aggregated = result.dissolve(by="car_r_t")

   # What do we have now
   result_aggregated.head()

Let's compare the number of cells in the layers before and after the aggregation.

.. ipython:: python

    # Number of rows before the aggregation
    len(result)

    # Number of rows after the aggregation
    len(result_aggregated)

Indeed the number of rows in our data has decreased and the Polygons were merged together.

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

    # Let's see how our aggregated data looks like.
    #result_aggregated.plot(color="b", linewidth=0.02)

    # Use tight layout and remove empty whitespace around our map
    #@savefig aggregated_polys.png width=7in
    #plt.tight_layout()

    # Indeed, the Polygon cells have been merged together!

Simplifying geometries
----------------------

Docs will be added here soon.

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

    What we want to do next is to only include the big lakes and simplify them slightly so that they are not as detailed.

    # Let's take only big lakes
    big_lakes = lakes.ix[lakes['small_big'] == 1].copy()

    # Let's see how they look
    big_lakes.plot(linewidth=0.05, color='blue');
    plt.tight_layout()

    # The Polygons that are presented there are quite detailed, let's generalize them a bit

    # Generalization can be done easily by using a Shapely function called ``.simplify()``. The ``tolerance`` parameter is adjusts how much
    # geometries should be generalized. **The tolerance value is tied to the coordinate system of the geometries**.
    # Thus, here the value we pass is 250 **meters**.
    big_lakes['geom_gen'] = big_lakes.simplify(tolerance=250)

    # Let's set the geometry to be our new column
    big_lakes['geometry'] = big_lakes['geom_gen']

    # Let's see how they look now
    big_lakes.plot(linewidth=0.05, color='blue')
    plt.tight_layout()

    # Great! Now we can see that our Polygons have been simplified a bit that are good for visualizing larger areas
