Running the Python script from ArcGIS
=====================================

Now that we have the interface and script ready for our tool, we can start using them from ArcGIS.

Before we can run the tool, we need to specify **which Python script will be run when the tool is executed**. This can be done from the ``Properties`` of your Script tool under a ``Source`` -tab. Add the
``PolyToRaster.py`` -file that we just created as the source file for this tool.

That's it! Now you can test your tool by running it from ArcGIS!
