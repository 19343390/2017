In this week, we will learn how to read and write spatial data, and how to deal with projections in Python using `Geopandas <http://geopandas.org/>`_ -module
and some useful data management functionalities.

1. :doc:`Introduction to Geopandas <geopandas-basics>`
2. :doc:`Managing map projections <projections>`
3. :doc:`Using own functions in GeoPandas <using-functions>`
4. :doc:`Exercise 2: Working with geometric objects <ex-2>`
5. :doc:`Exercise 2 hints <exercise-2-hints>`

Learning goals
--------------

After this week, you should know how to:

 - Read and write data from/to Shapefile
 - Create geometries into GeoDataFrame
 - Change the coordinate reference system of the data
